# 0030 Navarch: a ship of the fleet that brings in machines and assigns crews

- The navarch (`@aeolus-fleet/navarch`) is the trierarchs' plugin on the server side, optional like squadrons (0017): its own process, hosted beside squadrons, reaching each fleet only through the public API as a ship with `fleet:read`, `fleet:manage`, `crew:assign`, and the label scopes once labels exist. On or off per hosted fleet by squadrons' mechanism (0021); self-hosters import it or not. Aeolus knows nothing about it beyond its ship.
- No database of its own in the first version, a choice for now, not a rule: its state lives in the fleet. It follows the fleet's changes, and every check-in returns the latest full state, so a missed event never leaves it stale.
- Machines join through it: it commissions each trierarch's ship (with `crew:run`) and gives the operator its starting prompt for `aeolus-trierarch init`. It labels each machine from what its trierarch reports.
- It serves unassigned crew requests (0029) oldest first and assigns each to one trierarch by optimistic claim: of those that fit (repository, harness, model) and have room, the one with the most room as a percentage, then the oldest. Strategies to change this come later. The operator does not pick.
- A request no trierarch can take gets the reason written on it, shown in the operator's needs-crew to-do.
- A machine is silent when its trierarch's last seen is older than a threshold, flagged on the machines page and in needs attention. Nothing is reassigned automatically.
- The console reads crew requests and their status from the fleet, and the trierarchs (capacity, what they offer) from the navarch.

Why: the fleet holds the declared state; one plugin schedules by shared-state optimistic claiming, never bidding, and each machine only runs what it is given. The navarch will grow, so it gets its own process and package from the start.

Rejected: placement inside the server; machines registering or labelling themselves (a machine would enforce plugin policy on its own); automatic reassignment of a silent machine's ships; plugins that know each other (squadrons only touches ships).
