# Aeolus: build plan

Owner: Thomas Hendrickx.

How aeolus-fleet is built: in Claude Code sessions, one slice and one PR each, from the template below. No slice is open; git history holds what each built. A new slice gets a row here (slice, builds, done when) before its session starts. The trains in their own repositories (decision 0049) keep their own plans.

| Who | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Thomas (operator) | Scope, behaviour, every merge, every question the docs do not answer |
| Claude Code (per session) | Discovery in the repo, implementation, tests, the PR and its description |
| A clean-room reviewer (fresh session) | The only review: the PR against the slice's done criteria, before merge |

[blueprint.md](blueprint.md) and [architecture.md](architecture.md) are the source of truth, and [decisions/](decisions/) records why. When a session finds a gap, it stops and asks; it never fills the gap with its own guess. The design canvas is look and feel only ([design/README.md](design/README.md)).

## Still to do outside the code (Thomas)

- [ ] Branch protection on main: PR required, CI must pass

## Template: every slice

Fill the three bracketed parts from the build plan row. Keep everything else as it is.

```markdown
# Slice [N]: [name]

Read CLAUDE.md, docs/blueprint.md and docs/architecture.md first. Then read the code that already exists for the parts this slice touches. Do not read beyond that.

## Goal

[the "Builds" cell of the build plan]

## How to work

1. Before coding, write a short plan in the PR draft: the use cases, ports and adapters you will add, the tests you will write, and any question the docs do not answer. If there are questions, stop and ask them.
2. Load the skills CLAUDE.md names for the code you touch. Build inside out and test first (red, green, refactor, with the red commits in the history): domain and use case in core, then the Prisma adapter with Testcontainers tests, then the tRPC procedure.
3. Every state change writes its event to the event log in the same transaction.
4. Keep the slice thin. Anything outside it goes into the PR description under "Noticed, not done".

## Done when

[the "Done when" cell of the build plan]
- npm run typecheck, npm run lint and npm test pass locally and in CI.
- PR description: decisions the docs did not dictate, open questions, noticed not done.
```

After each PR: start a fresh session as a reviewer, give it the PR and the slice's "Done when" cell, and ask it to verify each criterion against the code and the test output by name. Merge only after that.
