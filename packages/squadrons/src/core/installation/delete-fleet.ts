 * Use case: the hosting service deletes a fleet from squadrons (decision
 * 0021): squadrons withdraws its declared network rules from the fleet first
 * (decision 0037), then forgets everything it holds of the fleet; its ships
 * and the labels it assigned stay there. A fleet must never keep rules nobody
 * can withdraw, so while the fleet does not answer the delete is refused and
 * forgets nothing, for the hosting service to retry. The request is kept as
 * its hash only, so nothing of the fleet stays; a replay answers the first
 * answer.
